Theming loopy
-------------

If you want to create a new theme:

- goto ~/.kde/share/apps/loopy

- if the folder loopy doesn't exists create it
  (or change the toolbar layout and you will get this loopy folder)

- copy the theme folder from the source package there
  (~/.kde/share/apps/loopy/themes)

- open this themes folder and rename a contained folder
  (~/.kde/share/apps/loopy/themes/blackglass-overkill)

- edit the contained style.qss

- open loopy preferences and load your style

NEW: loopy >= 0.5.2

- add the reload theme button to the toolbar, and you will see your changes on the fly
